- **Primary**: Main brand color
- **Secondary**: Accent color
- **Success**: For positive actions
- **Error**: For warnings and errors
- **Background**: App background color
- **Text**: Primary and secondary text colors

### Typography
Custom text styles are defined in `app_text_styles.dart`:
- Headlines (Large, Medium, Small)
- Body text (Large, Medium, Small)

### Spacing & Layout
Consistent spacing system in `app_constants.dart`:
- Padding values (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- Border radius values
- Icon sizes
- Common dimensions

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the color constants in `lib/core/constants/app_colors.dart`:

class AppColors {
  static const Color primary = Color(0xFF2C3E50);
  static const Color secondary = Color(0xFF3498DB);
  // ... customize other colors
}
```

### Changing Fonts
Modify the font family in `lib/core/constants/app_text_styles.dart` or use different Google Fonts.
